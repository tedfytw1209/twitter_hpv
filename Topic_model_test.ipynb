Could the results or could anything change from the time that you got it done?\", 0.754893958568573: \"Ask him if he'd like genetic testing.\", 0.832647442817688: \"And then the third test is a test called whole exome sequencing. This is a very comprehensive test. It's kind of like a deeper dive at the gene level. So our genes are on our chromosomes, you might remember. So this whole exome sequencing is essentially like a spell check. You'd be looking at all of Deacon's genes to see if there's any spelling differences, or we call them variants. Any spelling differences in any of his genes that could be an answer for the developmental experience. So the purpose of the test really is to try to find an answer for looking at genes associated with developmental delays. And not looking for likelihood of diabetes someday. I know there's a lot of different genetic tests out there. This is more of a clinical one that's just focusing on trying to find an answer for the developmental delay.\", 0.963973879814148: \"So types of results we can get back, particularly for the chromosome test and then the exome, whole exome sequencing. It could come back positive, meaning we found a clear answer and have more information about this is the diagnosis, this is the inheritance. Can kind of determine if there's anything else we should be looking out for, that type of thing. Sometimes a positive result is just an answer and it doesn't really give us a lot of extra information as well though. Testing could also come back negative. We know there are limitations to our genetic testing and the biggest one is just that we don't know everything about our genes right now. And so we can really only test for what we know of at this point. In the future, if we do get a negative result, we might be able to, in the future, we could potentially find an answer that we weren't able to identify today just because there's kind of a gap in our knowledge at this point.\", 0.8138400316238403: \"And we can also, when we do genetic testing, get an uncertain result. So I kind of think of this like our technology is a little bit more, is a little bit ahead of our knowledge in some cases. So like we can sometimes pick up subtle variations in the DNA that we just don't really have enough evidence at this time. We haven't seen enough people to know exactly if it is an answer or if it's just kind of a unique variation in his DNA that doesn't cause any problems whatsoever. We all have differences in our DNA. It's kind of what makes us unique. It doesn't always cause problems or symptoms, health concerns, things like that. So the lab will basically be scanning the DNA and trying to figure out if there are any changes that could give an answer as opposed to just sort of weeding out the things that are unlikely to be anything.\", 0.9227979779243469: \"Other things, when we do genetic testing, so particularly the whole exome sequencing, in addition to getting a sample from the child. We also send parental DNA samples along with the test. Having parents DNA samples can help with the interpretation of his test results. If they find anything with his testing, they will look to see if it was inherited from a parent. Sometimes that helps with some of those uncertain results because if mom or dad, if you have the same variant that he has and don't have similar features, then it makes us less suspicious that that's actually an answer for him.\", 0.701480507850647: \"Okay. Other things, sometimes people have questions about how results of genetic testing might impact health insurance, things like that. There's also a little blurb here about that. There is a law that protects people from being discriminated with employment and health insurance based on their genetic test results. I know we're talking about a lot of stuff right now. If you want more information about that, you can find that there.\", 0.9919794201850891: \"Okay, and then the last thing with the exome test, whole exome sequencing, you have an option of opting in or out of one set of information called secondary findings. There's also a paragraph on the board about that. So I mentioned the purpose of the test is really to try to find an answer for him as to what is contributing to the developmental delays he's experienced. So it focuses on those genes. And when I say those genes, just to put it into perspective, we have between 20 and 30,000 genes. And there are thought to be thousands of genes that can contribute to developmental delays. So it's a pretty comprehensive test that we're doing. But if you would like them, there is a list of 80 or so genes called secondary findings that they will look at. These genes are associated with genetic conditions that are probably totally unrelated to what's going on with him, but could contribute to long term health. Could provide information about medical conditions that are considered medically actionable. So these are examples of this would be rare genetic conditions that can be associated with certain types of cancers or certain types of health conditions or sorry, heart conditions. Whereas somebody has one of these things, there are guidelines on how to screen, catch early, treat, that type of thing. So this list was put together because there's actually something you could do about it if you were found to have one of these genetic conditions.\", 0.8348061442375183: \"So again, potentially unrelated to what's going on with him, families can say yes, I'd like them to look at that list. Or no, I'd prefer we just focus on the genes associated with developmental delay in this case.\", 0.9717080593109131: \"It's not a separate test, it doesn't cost more, anything like that, it's just they will either report changes in those genes or they won't, if you don't want them to. I will say it's not common that we find things like that. I think only 5% of the time we find something in one of those 80 genes that they look at. So, do you guys, how do you feel about that information specifically? That's the option you have with this test is often in or out of that extra information.\", 0.7839623093605042: \"Yeah, and one good thing about this list is they don't report uncertain findings in those things because that's not helpful for people.\", 0.9132294058799744: 'They may or may not have one of these genetic. Right. So at least their criteria is different. Like if you have a disease causing a change that they know would cause this condition, then they would report it.', 0.8563905358314514: \"So it's a little bit different there. And most of the time, cancer is not something that's genetic or inherited running in families. So testing negative for those genes doesn't rule out the possibility of cancer someday. It's just that of those genetic conditions they looked at, we didn't find any type of clear as a part of the genetic change. Okay, so anything they find in hand, they will look to see if it was inherited from other parents. So any information that's revealed through this testing could potentially be health information for the two of you as well.\", 0.6139882206916809: 'Mm-hm.', 0.6139752268791199: 'I was reading.', 0.6139882802963257: 'Mm-hm. There we go, whoo. All right, one more, okay? You all right?', 0.7548686265945435: 'TFP data, I tried to understand it.', 0.7965747117996216: \"So possible results of testing. One would be that we find an explanation for one or more of their symptoms. So we get a positive result. Sometimes that's just an explanation. But sometimes it can tell us that there's another health problem or something else that we need to do to take care of them differently.  It would also give us an inheritance pattern in the family. So if someone's positive, do the other siblings need to be tested for that same thing or has their previous testing already covered it? Those types of questions.  Testing could come back totally normal. We don't find anything. And then testing could come back uncertain, just like her previous testing. You're super familiar with that. I will tell the laboratory specifically about her variant and just ask them to tell us if it's present or not in the other children. I understand it was new in her. There's always a really, really small chance that they could carry it as well. Very small chance, but that would be of interest to us. Sounds like you've had counseling on that and you had to understand that. The test is focused on symptoms that they have today. There's an option to receive secondary findings. Did they talk about that with your previous testing?\", 0.9853163361549377: \"So secondary findings is a really select list of genes that have to do with an increased risk for things like cancer or heart problems. Usually that happens kind of later on in life. Some of them do occur in childhood. But they're on this list of things you can receive because there's something we can do about it if we find a risk for it. So there might be heart screening or if a female tests positive for an increased risk for breast cancer, there's early mammograms, those types of things, so they're actionable in some way. This present test is opt-in or opt-out. And so the lab gives you that option because some families might want to know as much information as possible and other families might want to just focus on why we're doing testing. Do you have any thoughts on that?\", 0.6140052676200867: 'All right, one more, so sorry, this is so many samples.', 0.6842473149299622: \"No? Okay. Essentially what we're doing is looking at genes that are associated with things like autism, learning differences, stuff like that. Have you learned about anything about genetics, biology in school yet?\", 0.6140117049217224: \"There's a gene that can cause that.  Is there?\", 0.7285539507865906: 'Okay. So in each of our cells, our body, our body is made up of cells. Each of our cells contain a whole set of our genetic information. It is essentially like the blueprint to our body.', 0.9902284741401672: \"Yeah, there you go. So our genetic information is what gives us the blueprint to grow and develop how we're supposed to, to make all of our organs work, make our brain work, all of those things. So in each of our cells, we have our chromosomes, like Grandma was mentioning, which keep our genes organized, keep them in the right spot. And we get, for each type of chromosome, we get one from mom and one from dad. So we have half of our genetic information from each of our biological parents. And then within the chromosomes, we have our genes, which are little segments of DNA that have specific jobs. So what this testing is looking at is genes that have to do with the way the brain develops and works to look for causes of things like autism. And so our genes are made up of a letter code. So kind of like A, the way a blueprint is written out to give us instructions. That's what our gene code does. This testing is reading through that code to look for any spelling differences in the code that's different than how we would expect them to look. And that can increase the chance of things like autism. Questions about that?\", 0.8274856209754944: \"No? Okay. So with testing, if we do the testing and find any differences, then the lab will go ahead and try to classify those in a couple of different ways. If we find differences that are known to be associated with symptoms, that would be like a positive result from testing. If in that case, we would provide you guys information over the phone about what that is. If there is like an underlying diagnosis that we can identify. If there are any other individuals in the family that would benefit from testing, we could talk about it at that point. Testing could also come back to negative. That doesn't mean there's not a genetic component. There just might not be one that we can identify right now.\", 0.6704200506210327: \"So we're learning about our genes all the time, and that might be a reason that we have you guys follow up in a couple of years or something like that to see if there's any additional things that we could do.\", 0.9427960515022278: \"Other possibility and result is that we get an uncertain result. So that is relatively common, and that's when we find a change in a gene that we don't really know what it means yet. Never been reported in anybody else. We just don't have enough information to know whether that's the cause of the autism or not.\", 0.6140021085739136: 'So, would you say overall, how have things been health-wise?', 0.7400069236755371: \"It's pretty common just because there's a lot of genetic information we don't super understand yet. So anytime we find something new, we get our interpretation of whether we think that might be a cause or not, but we often can't really say for sure unless we wait a couple of years and see if there's any additional information that pops up. But sounds like the plan also was to include samples from other family members. So the way that works is we'll do the main whole testing in Sookie, and then if we identify anything we would look for that in mom and brother to see how that was inherited. We wouldn't be able to tell, obviously, if things came from your dad's side if we don't have his sample. So that's kind of a limitation of only having a mom.\", 0.5717213749885559: \"Okay. Perfect. Thank you. So just collect those samples whenever you're ready and send them in. They won't start the test until they get their relative samples.\", 0.9802177548408508: \"So my kind of spiel is that so all of our bodies are made up of cells. Each of our cells contain a complete set of our genetic information. They're kind of organized on a couple different levels. So our cells contain our chromosomes. I think of them sort of as like bookshelves within each of our cells. And then the books on those bookshelves are genes. And with our genes, they're made up of a code that has a specific spelling. What this testing is doing is reading through the code or like the words in those books to look for spelling differences that would impact somebody's health or development. So essentially, it's called whole exome sequencing. And it's going to be reading through the code of all of those genes to see if we can identify any differences that are associated with his history with the autism, things like that, to see if there's an underlying genetic reason for that. So kind of benefits of doing this testing, sometimes autism can present as a feature of a genetic condition. So with those, sometimes autism is kind of one of the things that can happen, but there are other health effects along with that. So identifying if there is something like that can be helpful as far as whether there's any other kind of screening or things to look out for if there's an underlying genetic diagnosis. It can also be helpful if we identify something as far as your other kids, your own kind of health. That can be helpful for like recurrence if you're planning on having other kids, what that would kind of look like in future children. Questions about that so far? Sound like something you want to do?\", 0.9964603185653687: \"Okay, got it. So the way testing kind of works is we will take a cheek swab from both Noah and then both of you. And the reason that we use parental samples is if anything comes up on Noah's testing, we'll be able to see how that was inherited. So that gives us information as far as other family members can also potentially impact your health. So that's something I like to make sure people are aware of. But we'll not be doing any testing in you guys besides just looking for things that were first identified in Noah. So if Noah's testing is completely negative, we don't find anything. They won't even use your samples. We'll just discard them. We can get potentially a positive result from testing. So that means we found a change in a gene that's known to be associated with some sort of genetic condition, whether that's just a genetic explanation for the things he's already experienced or whether it's something that we need to look further into as far as other health effects of that genetic change. We can also get uncertain results from testing. It's a little bit not quite black and white sometimes. Essentially what that means is they find a change in a gene, but they don't know exactly what it means. The laboratory doesn't. So because this kind of testing is relatively new, we have over 22,000 genes. Sometimes we're finding changes in genes that we just haven't seen before. They don't know whether that's something that would impact the way that gene works and cause developmental differences or anything, or whether it's just normal human variation. We all obviously don't have the exactly same genetic code. Otherwise we'd all be clones of each other. So a lot of the times when we're finding new changes, they're just normal human variation. But if they report them as uncertain, it means that we just can't prove that. That makes sense. That's where parental samples could be really helpful as well. Because if something is uncertain, but it was inherited from a parent who doesn't have the same symptoms, then that can make us less suspicious that that's a cause for him. Questions about those things so far? I also have a handy-dandy handout that recaps all of this, if you forget that I'll send you home with, because I know it's a lot of information. Other things with testing that we tell you on the front end, we can find things that we weren't expecting. By including parents, we can tell if a parent's not a biological parent, doesn't come up frequently, but every so often it does. I like to tell people on the front end, you don't want to be surprised by that. We can also find information we weren't expecting, like parents being blood-related, that can show up in a child's genes. Again, not something we're expecting to see, but I'd like to warn you. Along with this testing, how it works, because we're looking at so much information, the lab is only really reporting things that we think are associated with the features he already has. They'll mostly be looking at genes associated with autism and other neurodevelopmental differences, but there is an option with this testing to find out other health information unrelated to his history that he already has. We call those secondary findings, and they are genes that are associated with health risks for the future, so things like an increased risk for cancer, increased risk for heart disease, that kind of stuff. That can be opted into or opted out of, depending on what your guys' goals are. With those genes, they only report things that are known risk factors. They won't report any of those uncertain findings, so how are you feeling about whether that's information you want from testing or not? Yeah, I say go for\", 0.6159711480140686: 'Okay. If we do find something like that, most of those genes come along with medical management guidelines, so recommendations for when and if he needs particular screening, that kind of stuff. So it can be helpful for making a plan for the future. Just some people are like, \"That\\'s not why we came here. Not information we want.\" Because the more you look for information, the more can of worms you\\'re potentially opening. Yes. But other thing along with that is if we find something like that in NOAA, it would be reported who it is inherited from, so that could potentially impact your guys\\' health as well. Most of the time, we\\'re not finding anything in those genes, but it does come up. And with any kind of uncertain or positive result or things that we need to talk about further, we can set up a virtual visit to do that, so you guys won\\'t have to necessarily come back here for a while. We can do a video visit with myself or one of our other genetic counselors just to talk about whatever it is the result is. If it\\'s completely negative, I\\'ll defer to Dr. McPheron when she wants to follow up. I don\\'t know if she mentioned anything to you guys, but normally it\\'s like a year or two. The reason behind that is if we do this extensive testing and they don\\'t find anything, we can actually ask them to reanalyze in the future. Since we\\'re learning about new genes all the time, new variants or new changes in those genes all the time, we can ask the lab to look at it again in the future. If you guys are motivated to continue trying to look for a genetic cause just because we can\\'t find something right now doesn\\'t mean we can\\'t in the future. Questions on all of that. I feel like I just talked at you guys a lot, so sorry about that.  Yeah, with his Medicaid, you will not have an out-of-pocket cost for testing. The lab we work with just kind of eats the cost of Medicaid patients, which we love, so you should not receive a bill. Usually testing takes about two to three months to come back. Quite a lot of data that they kind of have to sift through, and I\\'ll give you a call when we have results and kind of talk follow-up. If it is something positive or something uncertain that I want to personally talk to you guys about, it\\'ll be me. Otherwise we have assistance in our department that often helps us with negative results. So if it\\'s not directly from me, that\\'s why. We\\'re doing a lot of testing, so it helps us out a little bit that way. Yes. All right. Other things. So for your guys\\'s samples, can I have both of your first and last names and date of births? You\\'re fine. 10/26/86?  Okay.', 0.7548872232437134: 'The more comprehensive test.', 0.9544376134872437: \"I know. You've been through it all. Sometimes it can be kind of a question mark, but usually with our uncertain results I tell people not to worry too much about it or work yourself up over what it could potentially mean because at this point we just don't know and even our best kind of approximations from the lab and stuff can't always tell us what exactly that means. That sound okay Sophie?\", 0.8829906582832336: \"I think the only thing that I'm expecting to find is maybe cancer mercury, or the Alzheimer's thing.\", 0.9003547430038452: \"Because it wouldn't surprise me, especially since I have positive single variants of germ, so there is the other chances for reproductive cancers.\", 0.818941056728363: \"Exactly, yep. And then still with the negative result though, even if it comes back negative, that's still helpful. It lets us rule out a lot of different, possibly hundreds, thousands of different genetic conditions. And then the last type of result is a little bit more complicated, I suppose. It's called a variant of uncertain significance, or of the US for short. That just means that we found a change in a gene, like a spelling difference among one of them. But at this time, there's not enough information to determine, is that preventing the gene from being able to be read properly? Is it impacting the protein that it makes? Or is it just harmless human variation, just something that makes you unique? So not all changes in a gene cause disease. A lot of them are just accounting for a typical human variation. Often when we find those uncertain results, it might be the first time the lab has seen it before. Or maybe it's been observed in healthy individuals, but also individuals with similar symptoms. So a lot of the time, we just have to wait and just wait for more research to come out. Until then, we treat these as essentially innocent, until proven guilty. So those want to change your management, and want to be a diagnosis. But it would be just something that we could check in on over time and see if we learn more about it. Any questions about the types of results? Okay, and then another thing about the testing is that we can include parent samples if your parents would be interested.\", 0.8648562431335449: 'If your parents would be interested, the reason why it could be helpful is that it would help us interpret your results better. So an example is if we find one of those uncertain variants and we see it in a parent who also has similar symptoms, that can make us more suspicious of it. Or if we see it', 0.8061316609382629: \"Okay, perfect. And then another thing in regards to that, so it's only gonna be your testing. It's gonna be one test, they won't get their own separate reports. Any changes first identified in you would then be specifically looked at for them, so it's not like they would get their own results. And then the last part was the secondary findings. So generally the results are gonna be targeted to your symptoms, which is why Dr. Waiver spent all that time going through and getting a good medical history. So it wouldn't report out changes in genes that have nothing to do what's going on for you right now, but there is an option to include some types of changes, and those are called the secondary findings list. These are the genes that are associated with increased risk for certain types of cancers or cardiomyopathy. The idea being that if we found a change in one of those, then we can say, let's start screening you more frequently or-\", 0.8829870223999023: \"I'm gonna try to do the reproductive cancer screenings as frequently as I can, like once a year.\", 0.6294710040092468: \"Yeah, it's a good thing to fixate on, so. So I'm guessing you're okay with including those secondary findings on?\", 0.5689727067947388: \"I don't know, I just didn't know if that was included in the testing.\", 0.8029847145080566: \"And it sounds like, so we'll be using your brother as almost like a negative control. So if we find a variant in him and in you, that can make us less suspicious of it.\", 0.7659692764282227: 'I feel like the way to do it with kids is they grow out of it so quickly. Do you have more to add, Ms. Oakland? Well, I just wanted to talk a little bit more with you about the testing we were hoping to recommend for Oakland. A lot of times we recommend a pretty comprehensive genetic workup, just so we\\'re kind of covering our vases and getting a lot of that testing done for you while you\\'re here. So we were hoping to recommend a couple genetic tests for her. One is called exome sequencing and one is called a chromosomal microarray or just CMA. With all of our genetic information, I essentially like to think of our DNA kind of like our body\\'s instruction book. So we have lots of genes that are really important in telling kind of our heart how to develop, our brain how to develop. We also have lots of genes that are really important in kind of regulating how our body puts on weight and how we grow and how we develop. And so with that exome sequencing, it\\'s actually going through and essentially spell checking all of our genes in our body. That microarray, the chromosomal microarray test, essentially zooms out a little bit further and looks at our chromosomes, which are just kind of what hold up our DNA, and it looks for any small extra missing chunks of those. Kind of a big thing when we do that, the tests are pretty similar, but we would like to chat about what we can find when we do that testing with you guys. There are kind of three main possible results we can see. One being that we would do all of that comprehensive testing and we would find a negative result, meaning that we kind of ruled out a lot of possible genetic factors. That doesn\\'t necessarily mean that there\\'s kind of a 0% chance that there\\'s something genetic or hereditary going on, but it would certainly still be reassuring if we can rule out a lot of those things and have some better answers of what things we maybe aren\\'t worried about for Oakland. We could also kind of do that and find a positive result, and that would give us kind of a specific answer or a diagnosis for her. Anytime we do find a positive result on testing, we always like to meet with you again, whether that be another in-person visit or even a virtual visit. So we can just kind of really thoroughly chat through what we found, what it means for Oakland, how we can kind of best take care of her based on that, and what could that mean for other family members, such as if kind of Miss Oakland had future siblings as well. The last type of result we do sometimes see is what we call an uncertain or inconclusive result, or sometimes it\\'ll be called a VUS, and that just kind of stands for variant of uncertain significance. What that kind of tells us on our end is we saw a change or essentially a spelling difference in one of our genes, but just as a field in genetics, we don\\'t have all the information yet to say, \"Is that a change that\\'s perfectly normal variation between us, or is that a change that maybe could be an answer and we just need a little more information first?\" With any of those changes, we will always look really thoroughly into that on our end and set up a time to chat with you again so we can kind of discuss, \"Hey, is this something that we\\'re somewhat suspicious for, or is it something totally out of left field that we don\\'t think is related?\" We just kind of picked up because we went looking. Initially, I\\'m trying to know about that. Are there any questions I can answer for you about kind of possible things we can sometimes see on this testing?', 0.6960554122924805: \"Okay. Yeah. Certainly all good questions though, and we always like to make sure that you guys kind of going into doing any of this testing have an understanding of things that we can see or find on that. One thing that we often like to do with this test as well, just since it is really comprehensive, is include samples from parents when they're available. Would you be okay with sending a cheek swab for yourself to go along with Oakland's testing?\", 0.6517094373703003: \"Yes, I would certainly trust you there. One of those things that I have to technically tell you that feels silly sometimes when we're sitting with mom. It's a mess. Otherwise, when we do send off this testing, it does take a little longer to come back. Typically, it takes about two to three months to come back just because it's a really individualized and comprehensive test. I think in a month seems a lot more time. The last piece of the test that I always like to chat about with you guys is actually an entirely optional piece. It doesn't change how quick it comes back. It does not change costs. It's just an option to learn more about Oakland's health long term. So generally when they do this, of course, our main goal is just to see, can we find an answer for why she's had some more of those challenges? This kind of extra piece would be separate from that. It's something called secondary findings. It's an opportunity to learn about 80 genetic conditions. Importantly, when we find early, we can be proactive about them. It looks for certain hereditary risk factors for heart disease or potentially certain types of cancer. If we found them, we would have really specific medical guidelines. We can better take it.\", 0.795439600944519: \"So with that secondary findings piece, again, it wouldn't be related to Oakland's current health concerns if we found any of those that may not affect her health until she's an adult. But we would potentially have recommendations for, for example, if we found a heart disease risk factor, more frequent blood tests, more frequent scans of our heart with certain types of hereditary cancer risk factors, more frequent potentially mammograms, MRIs, and so on. For some families, when we do this testing, they really want to know kind of all the possible information and maybe knowing that stuff and being able to be proactive is kind of empowering. For some families, it can be really anxiety provoking. And I know it's kind of a really individual thing person to person. Do you think that's information that you guys would want to know?\", 0.6870375275611877: 'Yeah, that\\'s very... She told me that, so I was like, \"I think this genetic testing is going to be positive.\"', 0.754888653755188: \"And so that's kind of where I'm at.

But that condition, we can see some learning difficulties and behavioral difficulties, as well as a stronger appetite. So we just want to make sure that we're looking for that one. And then if that's negative, the last test is called Fragile X testing, and that's looking for one specific condition called Fragile X syndrome, where again, we can see some learning difficulties as well. So four tests overall. And the same deal with all of those. We can get three types of results. So I'll give this to you, but this summarizes it. The first type of result is a positive, meaning that we found a change that we know causes symptoms for somebody.

Or maybe sometimes if we see it in an unaffected relative, that can make us less suspicious of it. So ultimately, it's just for us to better understand Damien's results. And we'll be sure to interpret those once we have those results back.\", 0.8529244065284729: \"Pretty much the main thing is that we're gonna just be spell checking the instructions that tell your body to create itself and see if we can find an answer for why you've had some of the medical concerns that you've had.

It doesn't mean that there's not potentially any genetic factors, it just means that with our current understanding of genetics, we just weren't able to find one. That's still helpful information, it lets us rule out a lot of different conditions, but we probably wouldn't change management all too much based on that. And then the last type of result is called a variant of uncertain significance. You might be a little familiar with this at that point, but it just means that we found a change that we're not quite sure exactly what it does at this time. We all probably have hundreds of those and just never get genetic testing.\", 0.9374672174453735: \"With those uncertain variants though, we kind of treat them as like innocent until proven guilty, you know, it's not gonna change management.\", 0.8204116225242615: \"You know what, they're guilty until proven innocent cause they're there somewhere.

It's an explanation of why you have blue eyes.\", 0.6139189600944519: 'Facial features.', 0.6137264370918274: \"There we go, so you've got us all beat there.\", 0.8349085450172424: \"And then when we do this testing, generally it's geared to, so for that X1 sequencing, where it's looking at all of the genes, it's geared to only report out changes that would be associated with the symptoms that we're seeing for him. So I want to report out things that are unrelated, things like, for example, Alzheimer's risk. But there is an option for you to include some types of findings. If you would like, these are called the secondary findings. Does that sound a little bit familiar? So those are those conditions that are associated with--\", 0.7852354645729065: \"Right, and I mean, they're different. It's around 80 different genes, and the BRCA genes are included on that list. So just making sure that we're not finding anything that would have any immediate management or future management recommendations for him.\", 0.654242753982544: 'Like I said, depending on what the results come back of for the family situation, he has children that may need to be tested depending on what comes back.', 0.41224414110183716: 'All right. So Dr. Garcia had talked about doing exome sequencing for Audra to see if we can find cause of symptoms in the family. Is that a test that you had heard of before today?', 0.9956594109535217: \"Okay. Okay. Yeah. So it's kind of the most comprehensive test that we have available right now. And so even though testing will focus on Audra, it'll include samples from the both of you almost as a comparison. So when we do genetic testing, there's always a chance of finding uncertain results. And sometimes it can be helpful to understand who it was inherited from. So if we have an uncertain result that's inherited from dad, well, maybe that makes us a little less suspicious. Whereas if it's inherited from you, maybe that makes us more suspicious. So kind of is helpful in that way. And samples on all three of you can be cheek swabs. So that's great. In general, we're trying to find an explanation for symptoms. If we're able to find an answer for symptoms, sometimes it's just an answer, but sometimes it tells us that there's some other health problems to look out for or some way to manage symptoms in a different way. So sometimes it can help take care of people differently. In this case, if we have a positive result, it can also help testing at risk members that might not have started showing symptoms and just kind of understanding if they are at risk to develop symptoms or not. So positive result could be helpful in several different ways. Testing could come back negative. Our testing just is not perfect. We haven't discovered all of our genes, all of those reasons. One thing I do like about this test is we have the data. And so in the future, the lab will let us reanalyze it. And so we let a few years go by. It allows for new gene discovery, that type of thing. We can actually reanalyze it and potentially find an answer later down the line. Large chance of getting those uncertain results, like I had mentioned before. Sometimes those just we need to wait and see what we learn about them over time. If we do get a suspicious result, we can talk about it and see if it's worth kind of testing clearly affected relatives or maybe clearly unaffected relatives and seeing if we can sort it out through that. But we'll cross average if it comes. For the most part, we are focusing on what could cause odd just symptoms. Okay, do you know where this? Yep, perfect. Good job. For the most part, we're focusing on what could cause symptoms. The lab gives an optional an option to receive additional information that they call secondary findings. So an example would be a change in a gene that predisposes to breast cancer. Obviously not why we're doing testing today. Oh, there's someone in there. So obviously not why we're doing testing, but if you're defined that it's medically actionable. So there's something we can do about it, whether it's increased screening, medication management, that type of thing. So all of those conditions on that list have to do with cancer risk, heart problems, other kind of like, intervenable conditions. Thoughts about that?\", 0.5513969659805298: 'Okay. I imagine that would change if we have answers. ', 0.6605035066604614: \"Yeah. So if it comes back, either positive or with a suspicious variant, um, we often either try to work you in sooner or do a virtual visit. That's just like informational kind of in between. Okay. Um, so we'll kind of play it by ear based on results. All right. I'm going to do two on you. Okay. Easiest test you've ever done.\", 0.6604291200637817: 'Okay do you feel you have a pretty good understanding of genetics in general like the difference between genes chromosomes that kind of thing?', 0.9958215951919556: \"I'll give you my quick bio lesson and then you'll get ahead and it's cool because I'm sure you're not really learning that stuff yet um but basically what the testing is looking for so all of our bodies are made up of cells which kind of come together and make all of our bodies tissues and everything like that each of our cells contain a complete set of our genetic information so that's organized into structures called chromosomes that are in each of our cells the way I like to think of it is that chromosomes are like bookshelves and then the books on the bookshelves are our genes so each of our chromosomes contains several different genes and we have a pair of each of our chromosomes because we get one from mom and one from dad and then the genes or the books on those bookshelves they're made up of a letter code so essentially what this testing is doing is reading all the books so we're looking through all the words in all of those genes to see if they're spelled correctly or if there are any spelling differences that change the function of that gene so the testing will be reading through all of those genes looking for any differences compared to what we think we should see there so when we do that this is through that test called whole exome sequencing she might have told you that's looking at all of the genes when we do that if we find a spelling difference then the lab will go ahead and try to figure out what they think that means and they'll classify it in a couple of different ways so sometimes spelling differences impact the way that gene works they're known to be associated with some sort of genetic disease or some sort of symptom and that would be a positive result if we find one of those that is expected to kind of cause symptoms because of that change sometimes we find changes that are normal human variation they don't do anything to the gene besides just make somebody unique we all have little differences in our genetic code otherwise we would all look the same and act the same right so for those those aren't the type of things that they are reporting on testing and if we're not finding anything significant that would be a negative result and then sometimes we find a spelling change that we don't know exactly what it means so as we were talking about earlier genetics has come a long way but we have a really far way to go so often we're finding things that we've never seen before that are just classified as uncertain so sometimes we can get an uncertain result sometimes multiple uncertain results which can be a little bit frustrating to get that as a result of testing and i'm not sure you know in that previous testing she's done whether those are uncertain results or not but those often we don't make any management recommendations based on those depending on what the gene is what the change is we can kind of see whether that's something we're suspicious of or not but sometimes we just kind of have to wait on it and see if we get more information in the future okay that's sound okay i know sometimes the uncertainty is kind of hard for people to wrap their heads around but i just like to make sure that you know that that's a possibility \", 0.9132187366485596: \"another thing that can help with is including parents so that's why we would try to get a swab from bio mom if possible um because sometimes \", 0.9960662722587585: \"um the other thing i think dr law mentioned to you with this testing is the secondary findings so since we're looking at all the genes the way the testing works is we are mostly focused on things that would explain some of the symptoms she's already had so we provide the lab with kind of her history and they report out things based on that um but with secondary findings that's a list of genes that are associated with other health problems that wouldn't necessarily be shown yet so like a risk for health problems in the future and that is optional information whether you want those types of things reported on her testing or not um that could be like an increased risk for heart disease things like that um in her genes as well does that sound like information you're comfortable getting yes okay um with those they will not report anything uncertain in any of those genes so they'll only report them if it's a known risk factor they're not going to be you know any question marks on those types of things but the ones actually related to a cause for her current symptoms those could be more uncertain does that make sense yes okay um the other thing is if we identify one of those secondary findings so something associated with like an adult onset condition we could see whether that was inherited from mom if we have mom sample so that could be information that could impact her health as well okay so um just want to make sure you're okay with that um other things we can find from testing that we're not necessarily expecting to find but we can tell if a biological parent is not a biological parent if we include their sample um also can tell if it looks like parents are related by blood um often not something that we expect to find but it does come up so we have to tell you on the front end just in case um also along with this testing if we go ahead and send it we'll also do a second test called a chromosomal microarray that's looking more on the bookshelf level on the chromosome level to see if there are any chunks of those missing um the reason we do that in addition is just because the one reading through all the genes isn't as great at picking up large things in the in the genes so if there's multiple genes that are missing or extra not so great at picking that up so we like to do the chromosomal test as well okay that's something that may have already been done at the other clinic um so if we get those records i'll just plan to call you i'm just going to hang on to the samples i have a secure locked place in my desk where i can hold samples for a little bit until i get those records i'll call you let you know um and then once you get a call from me you can go ahead and send in amber sample at that

Or.  Okay, gotcha. So kind of in our role, what we'll do is we'll just collect some more information. I'm here personally to get the family history information. And then Dr. McPheron is gonna come in and she'll ask more details about how he's been doing. She'll probably do like a physical exam just to look up there, any soft markers that might point us toward maybe certain genetic conditions. And then depending on that, we'll see if genetic testing is appropriate, what type of test would be the best. And we can go from there. Does that all sound good to you?

Versus kind of, there's some findings where if we find a genetic cause for something that we know is associated with other symptoms on the line. Sometimes we have management recommendations that we can help be a little bit more proactive on. In terms of sometimes finding a bunch of soft markers that might predispose to certain things, our testing's unfortunately not really up to that sort of standard just yet. We don't really do testing for soft markers of things, various increased risks for in the future relating to diabetes risk, for example. But if we do find something on the testing that does have some management implications, and what we can do is have you back and talk more about where do we go from there.\", 0.7501886487007141: \"Yeah, so it depends on what the test is. But once we get those results back, we can send those to you. A lot of the time, it's pretty straightforward. They'll just list a specific variant that they found. Sometimes I know parents are interested in looking at raw data of the testing, which we don't really even have, we don't really see. But if you are interested, that's what the lab, all of the variants that they filter through, they eventually pick out variants that fit with somebody's symptoms usually, and they'll give a report on those that we get.\", 0.9374644756317139: \"That's the way that the testing just runs, is that they have criteria for whether they're suspicious enough for something to cause symptoms in somebody, and then they would report that out.

Sometimes a certain variant can be associated with a syndrome and cause a wider range of symptoms. And so that's another thing that we can do with the testing is if they do find a change that causes that syndrome, then we could say this causes autism plus heart defects, let's get his heart checked out. So it's kind of more of like that. Okay, gotcha.\", 0.8793143630027771: \"So often there are like a few different types of tests that we order and that's why we collect the family history and everything to see what tests would be the most appropriate. Some that we order when we see like family history of autism, for example, or like an individual who has autism or developmental delays. One's called a chromosomal microarray. That type of testing is able to look at the chromosomes and see if they're missing or extra pieces of it. Sometimes if we have extra information or missing information, that can cause an increased risk for some of those things. So that might be one that we go forward with. Ultimately, a Dr. McBern is the one who decides to test. There's some other testing that looks at the spelling of the genes. So we get there like smaller panels. Sometimes if we have like a very specific diagnosis in mind that looks at maybe like one or two genes or just like a group that we know causes one specific disorder. And the way that those test reports look is if they find a change in a gene, they write out kind of the specific spelling difference that there is. Different spelling changes in a gene can cause sometimes different symptoms too. So that's where the lab report comes in is they filter out certain variants that explain.\", 0.8204153776168823: \"I'll have to go look at all of the genetic code myself and try to figure out.\", 0.6467558145523071: \"And with the chromosome, the microarray, it doesn't look exactly like one specific letter change, but how they write it out is they show like what chromosome it's on, how big the deletion or the duplication is, and usually they'll include like how many genes are included in that area.

So.\", 0.984986424446106: \"To give you an idea, we have over 20,000 genes in the body and right now we only know maybe around five or 6,000 of them do. So even if we did some testing, it came back negative. Doesn't mean that there aren't genetic factors at play. Maybe a bunch of small little factors playing together plus some environmental and developmental factors too. And that's probably where a lot of our conditions are falling into those categories that we call multi-factorial conditions, you know, due to a lot of different small genetic factors plus environment plus development. And in those cases, our testing isn't really going to be able to pick up a lot of those. But if we do find, you know, one single gene cause and sometimes another thing is...\", 0.6368887424468994: \"Yeah, well she was talking about the secondary information. So that's not another comeback down here, you know, the slob, right?\", 0.9962214231491089: 'Right, yeah. So basically, so the test, the whole exome sequencing is what Dr. Law is recommending, which is essentially reading through the code of all of her genes. You guys have any familiarity with genes, chromosomes, that kind of stuff. So our genes are part of our DNA that have kind of a specific code that we share among people. Essentially what the testing is doing is reading through that code and looking for any spelling differences. And then what the lab does is they kind of classify anything that they might find. So we all have changes in our genes, obviously, otherwise we would all look exactly the same. But what we\\'re looking for are changes that are classified as disease-causing, meaning there are changes in the code that actually impacts the way that a gene functions and would lead to some health problems because of that. And because some of the eye differences, so she\\'s had some of the brain findings, there can be some genes that are associated with those types of things. So if we\\'re able to find a change in a gene that would explain some of her symptoms, it could provide potentially more information for the future. If there\\'s any other health problems associated with a specific thing that we need to be on the lookout for, it would also give you guys information as far as inheritance. So if you\\'re planning on having more kids, things like that, as well as when she grows up and if she\\'s having kids, what that kind of inheritance would look like. I know that\\'s really far in the future. So essentially the way the testing works, because we\\'re looking at over 22,000 genes, is they will only focus on reporting things that they think are an answer. So it won\\'t be pages and pages of pages of genetic changes. It would just be, if they find something and they think this might be an explanation, they would report that out, except for the secondary findings. So that\\'s anything that they find within a list of about 80 genes that are associated with later onset health problems. So things like an increased chance for cancer, increased chance for heart disease, things like that, that could impact her in the future, but we have no idea about right now, because she\\'s only six months old. So that is optional, whether you want that information or not. And they would only report out things that they know increase a chance for something. With the other findings, like things when we\\'re looking to find a diagnosis for her right now, they might report out uncertain results. So essentially, if they find a change in a gene and they think it could be related, but they\\'re not 100% sure, that\\'s not the case for the secondary findings. So that would only be things that they know are a risk, if that makes sense. So the secondary findings is a completely personal decision to you guys. Sometimes people are like, \"Give me all the information if we\\'re going to do it.\" All of those genes have management recommendations. So if we do find something that warrants additional screening in the future or things like that, that would be information we could provide. But some people are like, \"Let\\'s just deal with her being a baby right now. We don\\'t want to open that can of worms.\" That\\'s totally fine too.', 0.6140038371086121: '...secondary.', 0.977448582649231: 'It can. Sometimes, just with genetic testing in general, we can find things we weren\\'t expecting to find. Also, if we do find something, we would be able to see which of you guys it was inherited from. That would be something that would impact your guys\\' health as well if there is an increased chance for some sort of condition in your genes. So that\\'s a consideration. Some people are like, \"I don\\'t want to have to warn family members or whatever it might be.\" But they are genetic factors that are actionable. So things can be done as far as medical management, although actionable doesn\\'t mean curable. That\\'s just things to think about in general. Any genetic testing, even if we\\'re not doing the secondary findings, we can find things we weren\\'t expecting to find. Sometimes the biological parent isn\\'t really a biological parent. We can find out that kind of information. Not expecting to find it. Some people just... Yeah. It comes up for sure. Other incidental things we can find is whether parents are related by blood and didn\\'t know it. Sometimes we can tell that there aren\\'t genetic data. Because there\\'s a lot of shared genetic information if parents are related. So that can come up sometimes. Parents look like they\\'re fifth cousins or something.

But you\\'re right that it\\'s not going to necessarily identify treatment or something like that. That\\'s usually not what we\\'re using the genetic testing for. The other thing, I know I kind of mentioned it, but since we\\'re including samples from parents, as long as it\\'s okay with you guys, it could give you reproductive information for the future.

Third possibility for results is an uncertain result, which I kind of alluded to already, but essentially when they find something in the labs, not sure whether it's associated with health problems or not. It's usually because it's never been reported before. This type of testing, looking at all the genes is really, really new. So we're still pretty limited in our understanding of some genetic changes. When that happens, we do our best to kind of on our end, dig into it, figure out whether we're suspicious of this being a reason or not.

It's basically, like you said, just casting a wider NES is going to give us a better chance of finding an answer versus doing a bunch of smaller panels. So this testing is able to look at the exons, which are the protein coding regions of all of the genes. And when we do this testing, there are three types of results that we can get. So one is a positive result, meaning that we found a change that we know prevents a gene from working. And actually, that means that we found an answer for what's been going on. Those are also called pathogenic variants or sometimes mutations. But if we do find one of those, what we'll do is we can have you back virtually where we talk about, okay, what is this diagnosis? Is there anything that we should be doing differently for your care based on what we know about it? Things like what is the recurrence risk? And be sure to answer any questions that you have done. Alternatively, testing can come back totally negative, which means that we did not identify any genetic differences. That's helpful still because it lets us rule out a lot of different genetic conditions. But we can never 100 percent say, no, there's no genetic factor because there's still genes that we don't fully understand and still some technology limitations. But if we get a negative result, sometimes what we can do in the future is do a reanalysis of the data to see how we've learned anything else in these past few years that maybe this round of testing wouldn't have been able to find. Lastly, we can get what's called a variant of uncertain significance or a VUS for short. And what those are, it just means that we found a spelling difference within a gene. However, there's not enough information to say, is that preventing that gene from being able to do its job or is it just harmless human variation? Because we're all going to have some genetic differences between us that just make us unique. Often when the lab finds these, it might be the first time that the lab's seen it before or maybe they've seen it in some people who have symptoms and some people who are healthy. So in those cases, we essentially treat those as like innocent until proven guilty. It wouldn't be a diagnosis, but we would look into it and give you our interpretation of how suspicious we are of it for you. The goal is over time, those uncertain variants aren't going to stay that way forever. In a few years, maybe there's going to be new papers that come out that let us push it one way or another and say, okay, now we're more suspicious or now we're less suspicious. Any questions about the types of results there?\", 0.9320203065872192: \"Okay. With this testing, it can be helpful to send along parent samples if your parents would be interested or available to do that. It's not needed. It just helps us understand some of those uncertain results a little bit better. For example, let's say your mom has the exact same symptoms as you. We found that same exact uncertain variant in her that could make us more suspicious that it could be an answer. Whereas maybe we find it in an unaffected parent that can make us less suspicious. Do you think your parents would be open to sending in samples for this testing?\", 0.9931282997131348: 'Okay, then that\\'s fine. If after the case we do find one of those uncertain variants and we are pretty suspicious, we could also kind of do additional testing on the back end if they would like to. But ultimately, it\\'s not really going to make or break the test. One other thing about this testing is the way that it works is we are looking at all of the genes, but it\\'s still going to be focused on your symptoms, which is why Dr. Weaver went through all of that and got it all written down in detail. The lab is able to look through all of the variants that they find and they\\'ll only report out changes that could be associated with your symptoms. It wouldn\\'t report out things that are totally unrelated, such as Alzheimer\\'s risk, but it would report out things that could cause the symptoms that we know about for you. There is an exception to that and it\\'s an optional part of testing that you can include or choose to not include. There\\'s a group of genes called the secondary findings list. These genes, they\\'re around 80 or so of them and they are specifically curated and selected because we know that when those genes aren\\'t working, we have conditions that we have medical management guidelines for. Some examples are things like genes that are associated with increased risk for certain types of cancers or cardiomyopathies where if we found that that gene isn\\'t working, then we could say, \"Let\\'s get you in for screening more frequently or sooner or maybe start on medication to prevent from having symptoms.\" That\\'s not really the main purpose of the testing, which is why it\\'s optional. Sometimes people feel better having that information, whereas sometimes people feel like that would just cause them undue anxiety. There\\'s no right or wrong answer, but is there one way that you\\'re thinking, \"Would you like that information included?\"', 0.7542594075202942: \"Okay. So, sounds like we're gonna do some exome sequencing for Toby. And basically this test is the most comprehensive test we have available right now. It goes through all of his genes and looks for any changes that the lab thinks could be explaining his symptoms. So they do kind of focus the report on what could actually be causing his symptoms. And then we'll send Sister's sample for comparison. I can send a cheek swap kit home with you.\", 0.30492621660232544: 'Which you probably did cheek swaps for his last testing. Is that right?', 0.9427955150604248: \"Just so that her sample can be included as well.

One would be that we do find a straightforward answer. So we find a change in a gene that can cause developmental differences.

I'm a genetic counselor working with Dr. McPheron this morning. And in terms of my role for the appointment, I kind of covered talking a little bit more about the genetic testing that she's already had. I want to make sure that we sit down and have some time to explain what those results sound. And then Dr. McPheron will come on in and she'll do more of a physical exam, see if there's anything else that we would recommend for Stella. She'll collect some more medical history for her. And then based on that, since her current genetic testing was not a diagnosis, it ultimately was one of those results that found some uncertain variants. So we will likely order some further testing just to make sure that we're not missing anything. Probably something more comprehensive.\", 0.7548720836639404: 'Was that kind of your understanding?', 0.6778028011322021: 'Awesome. Well, I made this little set of slides that help explain some of the genetic testing results.', 0.9766292572021484: \"That's organized into structures called chromosomes. It's just DNA that's really tightly wrapped up. And then little segments of those are called genes. So sometimes people will think of it like a chromosome is like a big recipe book that tells the body how to grow and develop into a human being. And a gene is like one specific recipe in that book that tells the body how to make one specific protein that actually goes out into the body and does all the jobs and tasks that we need.\", 0.7730016708374023: \"If you look at a gene, you can see it's made up of a sequence of these repeating letters, the A's, T's, C's and G's.

That's just what tells us to be human beings. There can be some changes in the spelling where that's harmless and it just tells us that we're going to be unique human beings and have different characteristics from each other. But sometimes there can also be changes in the genes that prevent them from working properly. And in those cases, that can cause things called genetic conditions. Depending on the gene and the protein that we have. Any questions about all of that so far?\", 0.8635767698287964: \"Okay. And another bit of background information is there are a few different ways that genetic conditions can be inherited. We all have two copies of every single gene in the body. We get one from our moms and one from our dads. And in dominant conditions, you only need one of those copies to not be working in order to have symptoms. In recessive conditions, you need both of those copies to not be working. So the one that you got from mom and from dad need to have one of those pathogenic variants, sometimes called a mutation, in order to have symptoms. In these conditions, if you have one copy of the gene that's working okay and then the other one is not working, we call those individuals carriers. And carriers do not have symptoms themselves typically. However, it could impact their reproductive risk. So I'll kind of tie this back to Stella as we're going through. But any questions about this information?\", 0.5544615983963013: \"Yeah, so sometimes things can be passed down through families. Sometimes there are types of changes called de novo changes, which just mean that they're new and random in somebody.\", 0.6140110492706299: \"So should that be, I don't want to say requirement if you want to find out about her?\", 0.9302286505699158: \"Yeah, good questions. And then the last bit of information is just the types of test results that we can get. So one is a positive or one of those pathogenic variants. That means that the change that we found prevents the gene from working. Usually that means we found an answer for what's been going on. On the other hand, testing can come back totally negative, which means we didn't find any changes. Or that the changes that were identified were harmless or benign. If a negative result comes back, that's reassuring that it lets us rule out a lot of different conditions. But we can never 100% say there's not a gene factor because there's still genes that we don't fully understand and still some technology limitations.\", 0.8754957318305969: \"Good question. And fortunately, no. So the cool thing about our genetics is that we're born with them and they don't change over time. The part that changes for us is our knowledge of the uncertain variants. So basically that just means that we found a change in the gene. And at this time we don't know what that change does. So we know that she'll always have that specific change, but maybe more papers will come out that show that everyone who has the same symptoms as her are also having the same gene change that might make us more suspicious that that's the cause for those changes.\", 0.6818826198577881: 'Yeah. So until then, these uncertain variants, we kind of treat them as like innocence, health, living, guilty.', 0.9511178135871887: \"And then when it says heterozygous here, that just means that out of the two copies of all of these genes, only one of them had the change for each one. And then this is how the lab classified it. So we'll break it down. We'll first talk about the CFTR gene. This one's a little bit different because it was classified as pathogenic or disease-causing.\", 0.9806609749794006: \"However, we wouldn't really expect her to have symptoms as a result of this, and I'll explain a little bit more why. So the CFTR gene is responsible for helping the body manage the concentration of sodium. And that helps us through a series of long pathways, helps us make sure that the mucus in our body is soft enough that we're able to cuff out and still maintain bodily functions. When somebody has a pathogenic change in both copies of this gene, that causes a condition called cystic fibrosis. Have you ever heard of that condition before?\", 0.9853153824806213: \"And that is because this is one of those conditions that follows that recessive inheritance. So she only has one copy that's not working, and her other copy's working just fine. So she's just what we call a carrier of cystic fibrosis. Carriers would not typically be expected to have the classic symptoms. However, they might have some milder symptoms of CF, especially as they grow a little bit older. So we might see an increased risk for things like pancreatitis or diabetes, a bunch of a type of lung disease called bronchiectasis. So ultimately these things are more rare. Most of the time, CF carriers never know that they're a carrier unless they have genetic testing. And we would not expect this to impact her life expectancy or her management really, unless she did have any of these symptoms come up.\", 0.7548836469650269: 'Okay. Any reason why this could be helpful for her to know?', 0.9739041328430176: \"I wonder if sometimes they have little popsicle sticks that kids like to put, but I don't see any in here. So even though this might not be relevant for Stella's health, it could impact her reproductive risk in the future. That's because if her future partner is also a carrier of this condition, it could be a one in four chance for them to both pass on the non-working copy of the gene and therefore have an effective child. So if that's the case, a way to see if her future partner is also a carrier is to do a type of testing.\", 0.8204243779182434: 'Call a carrier screening.', 0.7288671731948853: \"And so I understand if it's not the biggest concern, but if that's something that when she's older, she's thinking about having a family, we'd be happy to meet with her and kind of review these risks. And I'm sure there's going to be updated testing by the time she's ready to have kids. But cystic fibrosis is actually a very common condition to be a carrier of. We know that for Caucasian individuals, around 1 in 25 people are carriers. So that's a big reason why we just like to make sure that people are aware of carrier screening just because it is pretty frequent. And it's not extremely unlikely that her future partner may be a carrier.\", 0.6877238750457764: 'So I was going to move on to talk about those uncertain variants. Any lingering questions about the cystic fibrosis?', 0.9691067934036255: \"Okay. So we also found a change in a gene called BRCA2. And this gene is associated with increased risk for various types of cancers if it's a disease-causing change. So again, her change is uncertain. We don't even know if this would cause this for her or not. But if she did have her variant be found to be pathogenic, then there would be an increased risk for things like breast cancer, ovarian cancer, not prostate cancer for her, but pancreatic cancer, endoskin cancer called melanoma.\", 0.683944046497345: 'With somebody who has both copies of this gene now working, it can cause a more severe condition called vianconia anemia. That again would not be relevant for her because she only has one copy of the change. Her other copy of this gene is apparently working just fine.', 0.6805315017700195: \"Now, does this uncertain one right there have anything to do with her neutrophilia, I think it's called? Because I thought they talked about some of her bone marrow is not working right or something.\", 0.9872646927833557: \"Yeah, and that's a good question too. So the way that this panel worked is it was specifically looking for changes in genes that are associated with the neutropenia and related symptoms. So every single gene that we're going to talk about is related to that in some way. It doesn't mean that that's the cause of that for her, but all of these genes, that's the reason why this one was even included on the panel. So I'm thinking that that's why we'll probably order the further testing is to make sure we're not missing potentially a different gene that could have caused that for her. So right now we want to change her management, we want to do any additional cancer screening and things like that. But let's say in five years we find out, okay, yes, we do think this changes pathogenic, then we can talk with you a little bit more about when she's an adult, maybe what we can do is start screening her more frequently or maybe start at an earlier age than we would for the general population. On the other hand, if we find that it's totally harmless, then we don't really have to worry about this. Any questions on this one?\", 0.6874566674232483: 'And then the other associated condition is something called Alagio syndrome. With this one, we see more bile duct abnormalities, so it often might present with jaundice or yellowing in the skin. We can see heart defects pretty commonly with this one as well, as well as a range of other additional symptoms. And again, because she has one of those uncertain variants, this is not a diagnosis of the side of those conditions. I know there is some overlap with some of her symptoms, like I know you mentioned, she is short. However, so many different potential causes for that.', 0.6140091419219971: 'Those certain symptoms.', 0.7511062026023865: 'And then the last bit here is just some additional resources. I think the MedlinePlus page could be really helpful.

But some more details. Yeah. And then this one's pretty cool in that it helps families keep track of uncertain variants. So if you were interested in getting some updates, like if there are new papers or new resources come out, you can make an account on this website and plug in Stella's exact variants. And then you would get periodic updates if there are any new papers. So you would just type in whatever the variant is there.\", 0.7267420291900635: \"Okay. So one of the main takeaways, nothing that we would change for management for now. Sometimes what we do is we have kids who have these variants follow up with us every few years or so.

And we'll let you know when we're fine.\", 0.6138842701911926: 'How has her development been along?', 0.7548940181732178: 'And it looks like we, you know, did some genetic testing.', 0.6139907240867615: \"Sometimes that's the case.\", 0.7228603363037109: \"Yeah. And I think there's -genetic testing is always evolving. So, there is always more testing we can do if new things come up.\", 0.9621334075927734: \"Yeah. I think the biggest thing is that can tell us whether there's anything to look out for. So, if she does have a small chromosome condition, sometimes we'll see there's a little more risk for kids with that condition to say need glasses. So, we might be a little more proactive about getting eye exams, that kind of thing. So, it doesn't usually change what you're doing. Just tells you if there's anything else to look out for.\", 0.682214617729187: \"Yeah, and I'm hoping that by the time she's older, we'll know a little bit more about those gene changes because they do update them if they learn new information. The lab will let us know. Oh, you played with this.\", 0.6140081286430359: \"So that's one of the three uncertain ones.\", 0.7548709511756897: \"It can. And has there been anyone else in the family that's had breast cancer?\", 0.9659737348556519: \"And I think, you know, those gene changes usually are inherited. So I think that's a little reassuring if no one in the family has had breast cancer that it's probably a behind change. But I think it's just something to talk to a genetic counselor again when she's an adult. And she'll want to anyway, since she's a carrier of cystic fibrosis. So just nothing to worry about for like 25 years. But when you're grown up, you want to talk to somebody.\", 0.6221234202384949: \"And otherwise, I just wanted to come in to chat a little bit more about that genetic testing that we were going to recommend for Leonie. What that test itself is called is something called exome sequencing. So her testing before was looking at all 46 of our chromosomes. This test would zoom in further and essentially it's kind of like spell checking all of our genes. So our genes are just tiny pieces of that DNA that essentially are a piece of our instruction book. When we do that, it looks at all 20,000 of our genes that we have in our body. So it is a really comprehensive genetic test, but it's also a really individualized one. So then the lab kind of goes through spell checks those and looks for any specific genetic changes that could give us an answer for some of Leonie specific developmental challenges. No, you are okay. Similar to what we had talked about before with the genome testing, there are still those three types of results we can submit. Three types of results we can see on testing of is possibly get back a positive result. And in any of those cases, we like to have you back to talk about those findings, blood our next steps, what does that mean for other family members? We also could get a totally negative result, which in a way would be really reassuring that we kind of looked at all of that and ruled out a number of different genetic conditions. Right. Just since we don't know everything in genetics just yet, we're kind of constantly learning year to year. That would mean there's kind of a 0% chance that there's some predatory factors, but it would still be really reassuring to us that we kind of ruled out everything we can look for and any kind of major genetic conditions. Okay. Knowing that we're seeing Ezio on Wednesday as well, sometimes what we'll do is we'll send testing on both siblings individually so they both still get their own work up and we'll kind of have the lab connect them behind the scenes so they kind of analyze it together knowing that they are siblings and is there kind of one unifying answer that can give us an explanation for both of their symptoms. Okay. So we can certainly kind of chat about that more when we see him as well and if that would be a good option. Okay. We also do sometimes still find those uncertain BUS results on this testing. If that's the case, similar to kind of our conversation today, we will always do our work on the back end to really look into that knowing your kiddo's history and kind of asking the question, does this seem like kind of out of left field and like it's probably just in that normal variation category or does it seem like maybe it could fit and it could be an answer. So that's always something that typically if we find one of those uncertain results or a positive, we like to set up another visit with you and we can even do that virtually just to kind of talk through those results and answer any questions. Okay. Yeah. Along with Leonie's testing, we often like to send samples for mom and dad. Is that something that you would be okay with and we can send them home for dad as well?\", 0.8733510971069336: \"Why we do that? Is it just kind of with it being that comprehensive of a test? It helps us understand their genetic testing results better. So we can also get one set of parent samples and just have the lab connect that with your son's testing as well if we recommend testing for him. But essentially what we do is just a cheek swab each of mom and dad as well. We aren't doing that full genetic test on parents, but rather if we first see something on kiddos testing, we'll just look at mom and dads to understand was it passed down from a parent or was it maybe a brand new genetic change in them and just can kind of help us better understand those chances. Okay. It is possible we learn something about mom or dad's health that would impact their care, though that's of course not our reason for doing the testing. And just something that we tell every family if there were ever any concerns for mom not being mom, dad not being dad, parents being related, testing could reveal that. It's never something you guys worried about. I wouldn't worry about it now either. Just kind of a disclaimer we always have to give before we send parent samples along with testing. Okay. Otherwise the last piece of this test is actually entirely optional. You and your family have the it's essentially just a chance to learn a little bit more about Leighani's health long term. As I mentioned, the main part of the test is really individualized. Our goal is just to see can we find a specific answer for her history. This optional piece is something that we call secondary findings. What it is is it looks for 80 genetic conditions that importantly when we find early, we can be more proactive about how we take care of people. Only kind of those known positive results would be reported so we wouldn't get any of those uncertain results related to those. It would only be kind of actionable findings. Some of the conditions in that list of 80 just to give you an example are like hereditary disorders that can increase our chance for heart disease. So we may potentially if we found that have recommendations for more frequent heart screening like blood tests or scans of our heart and or some of those things are genetic disorders that increase our chance for certain types of cancer. So for example if we found that it may be that there are recommendations for earlier and more frequent screening like famograms or colonoscopies. So again all of those things there's not necessarily a one size fits all pill that cures it but there are kind of ways that we can be more proactive about someone's health. Some families when we talk about this testing really want all that information possible kind of the ability to be proactive can be kind of empowering and helpful for some families that can be really stressful to know about those things and maybe isn't something they want to uncover. Do you think kind of thinking about your own family that's something you would want to know?\", 0.5918082594871521: \"Well, I just wanted to come chat with you guys a little bit more about genetic testing and it's Laura, correct? Perfect. Well, nice to meet you in Garland. I did want to clarify. So when Garland was with us before in the hospital, she had a test called exome sequencing. It's a really comprehensive genetic test. Specifically when we further up a kind of exome sequencing, what that means is it's looking at all of the parts of our DNA that our body directly reads for instructions. We were hoping rather than the reanalysis to actually recommend one step further, more comprehensive tests for her, something called genome sequencing. And that genome sequencing looks at all of those parts for instructions, but it also would look more comprehensively at all the little kind of regulatory reasons as well between those. Hi, sweet girl. And so, types of results we can see when we do that are very similar to the exome sequencing. We would still have kind of the three main types of possible results. One being that it would come back with a positive result that would give us kind of an answer or a diagnosis for Garland. If that's the case, we always like to set up a follow up visit with you so we can really thoroughly talk through what that means for her, how we can best take care of her based on those results, and what it means for kind of anyone else in the family. It's also possible we get that a totally negative or normal result just with where we're at in genetics that doesn't necessarily mean that there's no hereditary component to her symptoms. It may just be that we don't have the tools to find it yet. So in that case, we may still want to see you guys back in a couple years and consider reanalyzing that back in 2026. Last table result is one that kind of falls in the middle of those, it's full of BUS or an on-stimkey result. What that just means is we found a change, but we don't have all the evidence yet to find if it's related to her symptoms or if it's totally normal variation. And so again, if that is the case, we'll always set up a time to chat with you guys, answer any questions, and really talk through, is this something that we're suspicious could be an answer, or does it seem like maybe we just picked up normal variation on testing? I know you guys have seen us for a little while now, so some of that may be kind of review and you're certainly correct if it sounds familiar that it's very similar to what we talked about before. I know with the exome sequencing before we had sent a sample for you, Laura, would you be okay with sending a sample for yourself along with Garland's testing?\", 0.7732530832290649: \"That would just be a cheek swab for you. When we do that, we aren't doing the full comprehensive test on you yourself, but rather if we first see something on Garland's testing, they'll just look at your sample to compare and see if it had been inherited or passed out. And sometimes that can just help us interpret those results.\", 0.8989861011505127: 'So essentially the only difference is it just looks even more comprehensively at our DNA, and it can potentially pick up stuff that that exome wouldn\\'t have been able to pick up. It\\'s the most comprehensive test we have the ability to do at this point. And with Garland having Medicaid, that\\'ll also be covered by her Medicaid. We just figured if we\\'re going to send more testing, we might as well send the bigger, better test and then just reassess the test that she\\'s already had. When we do send samples for parents, like I mentioned, we\\'re not doing the full test on you yourself. It is possible we could learn something that could impact your medical care, but again, we\\'ll always talk about that on the back end. Are there any questions that you have about that information or about that sort of thing? The last piece of the test is just kind of an optional way to learn more about health information long term. Ultimately, our goal of doing this testing is just to see can we finally find an answer for Garland\\'s symptoms that can help us better take care of her. That extra piece would be kind of looking separately from that. It\\'s something that we call secondary findings. It looks at about age and genetic disorders that would we find early we can be proactive about. So some of those are hereditary conditions that increase our risk for certain types of cancer or certain types of heart conditions. And if we find them, we have specific medical recommendations for how we can better take care of people. So that may look like recommendations for earlier and more frequent screening like scans of our heart, blood tests, mammograms, colonoscopies and so on. Some families, when we do this testing, really want all the information possible, including that extra piece. Some families think, \"Hey, maybe that would be really stressful to know.\" And I\\'d rather just focus on our main reasons for doing it. Do you think you guys would believe none of the others that?', 0.8203931450843811: 'The tiny chromosome difference.', 0.5760425925254822: \"Okay.  Yeah, that's a good question. So you guys are familiar with GNO, which protects us in terms of health insurance, but not necessarily life insurance. So the way testing goes is it's first done on RJ, and then they'll report out any variants. If they find a variant in RJ, they'll say it's inherited from mom or dad. There's no independent testing being done on you. For the most part, testing is kind of focused on what could actually be causing RJ symptoms, and so would be targeted towards genes for PCD. There's always a chance that we could find something that was inherited from you that we're not expecting, that type of thing, but you're not going to get your own separate report. Okay. What that actually means for life insurance, I'm not sure, like does it matter?\", 0.7015915513038635: \"Yeah. If we don't find a straight-forward answer for his symptoms right now, that's kind of the purpose of reanalysis in the future as well. The thought would be we discover new genes for respiratory differences and that type of thing and so we could reanalyze to look for a cause for his symptoms as well. We could find more uncertain results. Yeah. He's already got a lot of those. He's got a lot of those. I'm hoping we kind of find something that's He's got a lot of those. I'm hoping we kind of find something that's straightforward that just helps you guys, you know, understand his health concerns a little better.  Yeah. I think that's a good way of framing it. So we're sequencing all of his genes and so the panels, the limitations are those panels are kind of curated at a certain point in time and so if there was an, if that was made in 2010 and then there's genes that are discovered to be associated with PCD in 2012, that panel is going to be missing those and so it's almost like this will repeat all the testing that's been done but also look at any other genes that might have been found to be associated more recently. So it's kind of filling in gaps I think of it. Our chances of finding something might be slightly lower just given he's had a panel before but...  We could find something that's very very new. Okay. Sometimes they report out what we call candidate genes that are thought to be associated with something but it's not 100% certain and so those could be reported out. Okay.\", 0.8202286958694458: 'Tell her about your dog tell her about Moo Moo', 0.8277868032455444: \"I think that is... that just means that the testing found maybe a change in a gene, but at this time there's not enough information to say, is it a positive result? Could it explain the symptoms that we're seeing? Or is it a harmless genetic change? You know, just something that makes her unique. Not all changes in a gene are going to cause symptoms for somebody. A lot of it's just what accounts for typical human variability. And when we find those uncertain variants, it might just be the first time that the lab has seen it before or maybe we've seen it in some kids who have these symptoms and other kids who don't. So often it just takes a little bit more time and research to be able to categorize it in one of those boxes or another.\", 0.870852530002594: \"With those uncertain, that's why it's helpful to send along parent samples. You know, if we find that uncertain variant and a parent who doesn't have the same symptoms, it's more likely to be one of those harmless changes. Whereas if we saw an apparent with the exact same symptoms, that could make us more suspicious. Another thing is when we send all our parent samples, we just have to let everyone know that testing can identify things like if parents are related by blood or if there's non-paternity or paternity. Usually that's something people know ahead of time though. So just a heads up. And then the last thing to kind of go through with the testing is there is an option for you to include some types of genetic differences if you would like. So generally the way that the testing works is we send along information about Lily and her symptoms in the lab, even when we're spell checking out all of the genes. They're only going to report out changes that would have overlap with her symptoms and want to report out things like all time risk or something totally unrelated.\", 0.9817194938659668: \"But this list, there's a list of around 80 different genes that are called the secondary findings list. And those genes don't necessarily have anything to do with what's going on right now, but they are associated with conditions that we have medical management guidance for. Some examples being increases for certain types of cancers or cardiomyopathy. And the idea is if we find a change that increases the risk for those things, we can say let's start screening her sooner or more frequently or things like that. Sometimes people want to know that information because it could be helpful, but sometimes people would also feel just more anxiety having that, which is why it's an option. Do you have any thoughts when we're the other, whether you would like that?\", 0.9132297039031982: 'Um, they just said they would mostly check for any other, um, genetic, um, diseases or stuff like that.', 0.9427817463874817: \"Yeah, basically. So what we're doing is called a panel genetic test, which means it's looking at a select few genes, and they're all ones that are associated with different connective tissue disorders.\", 0.7775235772132874: \"Um, so things like, um, different types of EDS, that kind of thing that we can identify on a genetic test. Um, kind of thing to remember is that not all EDS we can actually locate a genetic cause for. So things like hypermobile EDS, we still don't know what causes it on a genetic level. Um, so it won't like rule that out or in.\", 0.6206328272819519: \"They are. Yeah. Yeah. There's a couple different studies going in. You know, there are some candidate genes that they think are probably involved, but not things that we can test clinically for yet. Um, that'll hopefully be available eventually. But, um, so essentially do you have any kind of knowledge of genetics, chromosomes, all those kinds of things?\", 0.988162636756897: \"Yeah. So essentially our genes are, our instruction manuals to our body. Each of our genes kind of have their own job. So we're only looking at those genes associated with kind of connective tissue, those sort of things. Um, and how the testing works is it's essentially reading through the sequence of all those genes or the way that those genes are spelled. And to look for any spelling differences that would make the genes not work the way they're supposed to. That's kind of what we're looking for. If we find one of those that we know is a change that disrupts the way a gene works or something like that, that leads to symptoms. Um, that would be a positive result. One of our potential, um, kind of results from testing. We can also have a negative result. So if we don't find any of those, again, doesn't take away any of the diagnoses that you've been given. Um, just kind of rolls out some of those different connective tissue disorders.\", 0.9907668232917786: \"Great. Exactly. Yeah. I think that's how a lot of people feel. Um, the one thing to note with results is that we can get uncertain results on genetic testing and it happens pretty frequently. Um, especially on testing for connective tissue disorders because there's still so much that we don't understand. Um, essentially an uncertain result means we find a change in a gene that we weren't expecting to see, but we don't really know what to make of it yet. Usually that's because it's never been reported before. We don't have any kind of data to go off of as far as what that change specifically does. Um, and with that, it can be a little bit frustrating. Um, sometimes we can do some steps to clarify it, like testing parents, things like that. But sometimes we just have to kind of wait on, wait on it to see if there are any updates over time. But with uncertain results, we don't ever treat, we treat them as innocent until proven guilty. So we don't change any kind of medical management based on those results. Um, unless we have a clear diagnosis, it won't change kind of your plan of care.\", 0.8023625016212463: \"Like ancestry type of thing. Yeah. So with any kind of genetic conditions, there are some that are more common in certain ancestral groups for connected tissue disorder specifically. I'm not really sure exactly what the demographic breakdown is. That's actually interesting. I feel like I should look into that.\", 0.9543038010597229: \"Yeah, for sure. And like there are certain ancestral groups in general that just have a higher incidence of certain genetic conditions. Just because, you know, they're from the same geographic location, shared kind of gene pool over time. Um, yeah, connect tissue disorders. I don't know if there's a association with any specific group in general, but if we do, you know, kind of come up with a diagnosis out of this, then at that point, we could have a like a virtual meeting. Um, just to talk about it in a little bit more detail, what that looks like. And then more kind of that information as far as how common is it? Um, what kind of symptoms does this explain for you? So questions about that?\", 0.8204025030136108: 'Have you done like, ancestry testing and that stuff?', 0.807799756526947: \"That's so interesting. Yeah. Unfortunately, this will not give us any information about your ancestry, but we will see what kind of those connective tissue disorder genes look like for you. Again, if it's negative, it doesn't take away like an HEDS diagnosis or that kind of thing. And if it's uncertain, that doesn't mean it's abnormal. Most people who get this testing done will have an uncertain result or two. It's also possible to have a combination of results. So like a couple uncertain findings, a couple, you know, kind of mixed bag can happen as well. So. Sounds good. So you have active Medicaid, is that right?\", 0.5568910241127014: \"Yeah, you can't sit. You can't pee, poop, anything. So, I really, at that point, looking back, I'm like, oh, I don't know that I did the right thing, having that biopsied. But I don't know that I really had lived with not knowing what it was. But they still don't know what it is. So, some people think it's like mast cell. Some people think not. Because it's really what I found with doing like this alternative medicine and taking the supplements is it, if my thyroid is off, that thing blows up. So, I used to think it was just solely mass cell linked. But now I'm finding with like the CRT is in like just changing my thyroid supplements. If that is messed up, then that mass blows up. There's something with my thyroid that's linked to that.\", 0.6139765381813049: \"Who knows?  It's puzzling, isn't it?\", 0.6738981604576111: \"That helps a lot. Because it forces your brain into a wave function that's more calming and more of a place for change to occur. So that when you are taking all these treatments and supplements, your body is more adaptable to the change. So I think that's like pretty high on the list for helpfulness.\", 0.8829249143600464: \"So. If that's the closest kind of medical center type.\", 0.7382426857948303: \"So depending on your lipid profile and then probably they'll also be doing some molecular testing to see if you have gene variants and the genes that are known to cause familial hypercholesterolemia. They can give you an idea about your risk profile and then they can also make recommendations in terms of treatment.\", 0.6140022277832031: 'So are you supplementing those things that have been deficient?', 0.6140027642250061: \"And I'm not sure I know about that diagnosis.\", 0.8581911325454712: 'Okay.

Should we, I'll let you um or yeah. I guess you can anything I don't have to sign. Yeah okay. Um okay, so first before I kind of get started, well actually I will just kind of start from the beginning. Um so the test that we're going to order is called whole exome sequencing. Um and so I mean this might sound familiar something that you're aware of but just to make sure we're on the same page, humans are made up of billions of cells. Within those cells we have our long strands of DNA. Um DNA can be broken up into subunits called genes and genes are like the instruction manual for our bodies. They tell us how to make proteins, proteins carry out our bodily functions. Um so this testing is really one of the tests that we have um or clinically available tests. It's the large, one of the largest if not the largest one we can do clinically right now. Um it's going to go through and look at essentially all of your genes to look for any changes in them that would explain your symptoms. Um it doesn't actually go through and look at all of your genes. It takes the symptoms that we report that Dr. Frank Romano found clinically and kind of filters through the genes that we know to be associated with your family history um and your clinical symptoms. Um and we'll go through look for any changes that would potentially explain why you've been experiencing what you're experiencing. Um there are a few possible test results. So one would be positive meaning we identify a change that does explain your symptoms. The other possibility is negative meaning we do not identify any changes that explain your symptoms. Um I would expect that one change that was identified on your previous panel to pop up if it was in fact um a positive result. Um the other possibility is an inconclusive result meaning um we find a change in the gene but we don't have enough information right now to say is this causing disease or is it just normal variation because everyone has changes. It's just a matter of if it's causing um a genetic condition or just like a change that isn't really doing much to the protein and causing that. Um do you guys have any questions so far? Okay um the other thing is sometimes for this test we do like to include samples from parents. Um it's not something that we have to do um but it is something like really if we had like an inconclusive test result sometimes it can help us interpret those um because if you had a inconclusive change and it was inherited from a parent who is unaffected in that way we would think it's a little bit less suspicious. Um however we can always follow up with testing as well um depending on what we find in you and you know all that. So it's kind of up to you and if you would want your parents I would have to contact them um to kind of walk them through the same consent because they wouldn't have the whole test done but they would be tested for things identified in you. I know my mom is definitely I don't know\", 0.448226660490036: \"okay so you will see them this week yes okay then I'll give them a call to if it's okay did they know that you had this appointment yeah okay then I'll give them a call today within the next couple hours I have lunch after this but then I'll call them um and at least leave a message um there are in this kit there are two cheeks wobs um one for your mom one for your dad um sorry if I can get this open I'll show you um so one for mom one for dad um and then you will just place them in this bag you hear there are labels so just make sure that you whatever cheek swap goes with mom you put name and date of birth on that sample and same for dad and then it comes with a prepaid fedex bag and shipping label that you just package it all up um and ship it or drop it off at your nearest fedex drop box um and the lab will have that information so they'll be able to connect to their samples to yours um so I'll give that to you guys um I would just make sure if they don't want to do it then they can let me know on that phone call and just or just decide not to don't send them in um because if they don't send them in and they they just won't be you know but I guess I would want to know just to kind of make the process move faster but yeah um but I'll be on the phone with them so we'll try and figure it out that way um and then there is one last type of finding so there is a um there's secondary findings this would not increase like the turnaround time or the cost of testing or anything like that um they are a set of findings that are mostly associated with adult onset disease um sometimes it can change management and like childhood or adolescence for some people um but those are mostly associated with in or predispositions to cardiovascular disease or cancer um and all of the genes on that on that list do have management recommendations in place so um some of those would be like a predisposition predisposition to breast cancer um which I know has been in your family history of that young age um it would test for a few of those genes and it those specific ones would be associated with management recommendations so um it would be like you know earlier or more frequent for a female it would be earlier more frequent mammograms um for someone who doesn't have breasts it would be a little bit different because there are different types of cancers typically associated um but that would be kind of like an example of what to expect do you think that you would want to opt in of those for those okay um so the only caveat with that is because you do have a family history of cancer I do want to make sure you're aware if you test negative um that does not mean that there isn't a hereditary cancer in the family because it's possible there is and you just didn't inherit it um and there are also other genes out there that can be associated that might not be um on that secondary findings list so just kind of rule it put that out there um and then I kind of also wanted to stop there and make sure do we want to wait until we like kind of get those results back before you consider that cancer genetic counseling referral or do you want to go ahead and have that okay um then we'll go ahead and I'll get you there um it's possible you'll have to test results back anyway before you would get in with them so we might be able to it might kind of speed things up as well so no cost of testing we don't expect you to get a bill because you do have medicate correct okay um and it usually takes so they will wait um just through a cheek swab two cheek swabs for you usually they wait about three weeks to get your parents samples um I know you mentioned that they'll be here this week so you'll have to get the sample this week um but just make sure you mail them out within that like you know a couple weeks because if they don't have it within three weeks they will proceed without them um and then once they can start the testing so as soon as they get those or if I notify them that they're not going to participate um then it takes about one to three months to get test results um and I'll call you with what the results are and kind of schedule follow up based on that all right um any other questions for me all right I'll just let you do this um you just swipe it inside your cheek um about 10 times each side and then you can hand it back to me thank you and then there is always the possibility that these samples fail if they do though we just mail you a new one to your home and it works the same way as what I'm sending home with your parents and I'll also let them know that if they were to like test positive for those secondary findings or something um if they are in Florida I would not be able to provide genetic counseling to them um so the only caveat is if they did also test positive we would want them to be connected to someone in genetics in Florida most likely at least depending on what the result is okay um so if you guys don't have any other questions for me I think that is all that I had air forms on the bottom oh yeah and I think you guys are waiting for Dr. Frank Amano's discharge okay um you should be able to see my like test consent in the patient portal if you want to go back and like review any of what we discussed um thank you and then I'll look into this too and I'll whenever I call you at I mean I'll call you at some point for the results or something we can talk about this as well um let me run while you're waiting on her to go get you a piece of paper as well if they have it I'll be right back\", 0.6139867901802063: 'You know, I just have to say, just looking at the two of you, you must be related.',

If you want to fill that out first, that's totally fine. Or we can start talking. Either one is totally up to you. Or you can fill out and listen and we can multi-test too. Yeah, okay. Alright. Perfect. So Dr. Frank Amano recommended the Hairdouble Disorders of Connective Tissue Panel. And that's looking at a handful of different genes related to connective tissue, different conditions. So just kind of background in that biology lesson. So we all have DNA and the DNA that makes up our chromosomes is made up from a sequence of chemicals or bases that are, you know, four letters, which are A, T, C, and G. Hopefully that's sounding a little bit familiar, yeah. So basically DNA is broken up into segments that we call genes and each gene has specific functions in our body to kind of help us grow, function, do all of the things that we do. So as I mentioned, those genes code for different proteins that go on and help our body do the work it's supposed to. And this testing is looking at the spelling of a handful of different genes, again, related to those connective tissue disorders. And kind of the purpose of that is to just see if we can identify any underlying genetic explanation for some of your symptoms that you've had that could kind of help us with any management recommendations in the future. Any kind of questions about the panel that we're doing, why we're doing it, what it's looking at?\", 0.8117183446884155: \"I guess like the only thing that he cares about is just like what it's looking at. I know it's meant to like roll out and stuff, but I wasn't aware that there were like, I mean, it makes sense that there'd be other like connective tissue like genetic disorders and things, but like, what am I blowing? That's news to me.\", 0.7713971138000488: \"Yeah, absolutely. So we can actually do swabs in a while, talk about insurance in just a second, but we can do swabs today. Results typically take around three to four weeks after the lab gets it. So either myself or one of my colleagues will review a phone call with those results and we'll kind of go through them with you, explain them and just kind of make sure you have all the information that you need. And kind of talking about results. So types of results that we can get from genetic testing, there's really three types. So a positive result basically means that we found a spelling change in one of those genes that, you know, is associated with different symptoms at different condition. We could receive a negative result. So no genetic changes were found in any of those genes. And we also could find an uncertain result or a variant of uncertain significance. What that means is that we found a spelling change in one of those genes, but the lab just isn't sure if it's in that positive or negative category. There's just not enough information at this point. So they'll do a little bit more research. We'll do our own digging into those specific results just to give you as much information as possible. And then we'll kind of follow those through the future. And if they were ever changed, reclassified, we would kind of update you about that as well. You know, a negative genetic test doesn't totally rule out a genetic explanation for some of your symptoms just because we're only looking at a handful of genes. We have, you know, 23,000 different genes. There's a lot. And there's also a lot we don't know about. Technology can also be limited. We have really good technology, but it's not perfect.

I'm gonna nerd out What we're looking for are what we call more Mendelian disorders where it's the one specific change That's inherited is the cause of the symptoms But there can also be conditions that are multifactorial, which is where there's a bunch of different genetic factors Plus environmental factors, maybe there are two different genes that are interacting to cause the symptoms That so it's a little bit harder to determine some of those things and I think that's what Dr. Frank Amano is looking at \", 0.6923259496688843: \"No, that's not dumb and actually what we can do is if it comes back with a variant Then we can go back and test parents to see who it came from which way Okay, yeah, and sometimes the lab if it's not helpful to reclassify the variant They might not offer it, but sometimes if having a parent sample allows us to reclassify it. They might Not use it to diagnose a parent but to help us understand the variant a little bit better So like you're saying if you know if we find one of those uncertain variants and dad who has those same symptoms then That might be enough information for us to say, okay Yeah, we think it's probably a pathogenic or probably if possible a positive result\", 0.4161854088306427: \"I was just thinking because there's different things that you know like maybe a alone and be alone Would be a big deal to be a variant but when you have a and be together, right?

That's why I haven't been able to find an answer. Because I've been looking.\", 0.9945275783538818: \"got it. Okay. So essentially the purpose of the testing is to see if there's an underlying genetic cause that we can find for some of your symptoms that would provide an explanation for those, potentially a diagnosis that would kind of guide care in the future, even if it doesn't specifically open up any treatment options or anything like that. It can be helpful to know for if you have children, things like that, for like how things are inherited. So essentially what the test is doing is looking at genes that are associated with all kinds of connective tissue disorders. So our genes are in each of our cells packaged into our chromosomes. And in any of those genes, if we have a change in the gene that impacts that gene's function, that's when we can get symptoms of a genetic condition. So it's not comprehensive testing. So if it comes back normal, that doesn't mean that you don't have an underlying connective tissue disease, especially things like hypermobile EDS do not currently have a known genetic cause, even though we know that they run in families and everything. We're not able to localize exactly what that is and what gene that is. So this will be looking at other connective tissue disorders where we are able to localize a cause and seeing if we can rule in or rule out any of those things. I know one thing that was brought up, I don't know if Dr. Francomano mentioned it to you, but with some history of like vision differences, hearing loss, things like that, we can be a little bit more likely to find a genetic cause with like a connective tissue gene that's leading to those problems. So that's part of the reason of doing the testing is to rule that out. Questions about that so far? Okay. So with this testing, it might come back completely negative. Maybe we don't find anything. Again, that doesn't take away any diagnosis. It doesn't take away any of the experiences that you've had. It just means we can't find an exact cause for you right now. It could come back positive, meaning we find a disease causing change in one of those genes. And with that, we would kind of create a follow-up plan myself and Dr. Francomano as far as sitting you down to talk about it a little bit more, seeing if there's anyone else in your family, it would be helpful to test that kind of thing.\", 0.8133619427680969: \"Right. So if they find a genetic cause for you, then that would be pretty easy to test your kids to see if they have inherited something from you.
